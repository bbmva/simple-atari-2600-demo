imple Atari 2600 Demo

I visit SvOlli's "Retro Demo Coding" workshop at the 31C3 and after some cleanup this simple demo is my result.

For watching the demo you will need a emulator like Stella. Building the binary will require the DASM Assembler. The workshop slides and build-tools are available on SvOlli's website.
